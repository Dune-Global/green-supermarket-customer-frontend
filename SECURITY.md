## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell users how to report a vulnerability for your alpha release project. You can set the reporting process like this:

To report a vulnerability, please create a new issue in the project's issue tracker on [GitHub](https://github.com/Dune-Global/green-supermarket-frontend). We encourage you to provide as much detail as possible, including a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any relevant technical details.

### Response Time

Since this project is in its alpha release, we will make our best effort to respond to vulnerability reports as quickly as possible. However, please be aware that response times may vary during this early development stage.

### Vulnerability Resolution

Once a vulnerability report is accepted, we will prioritize and work on resolving it. As the project is in alpha, there might be more frequent updates and changes, so please stay updated on our progress through the issue tracker.

Please keep in mind that vulnerabilities in alpha releases may be addressed in subsequent releases, and your contribution to reporting and helping us improve the project is greatly appreciated.

## Disclaimer

During the alpha release, the project is in active development, and changes may occur frequently. Please use the alpha version for testing and development purposes and not in production environments. We appreciate your feedback and contributions to making this project more secure and reliable.
